# Text2Emotion-Text Emotion Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **machine learning-powered web app** that detects emotions from text input — such as **tweets, messages, or sentences**.  
Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, it classifies emotions like:  

😊 Happy | 😢 Sad | 😡 Angry | 😨 Fearful | 😲 Surprised | 😍 Love ... and more!  

The goal is to make machines understand human emotions hidden in text, helping in areas like **social media monitoring, mental health analysis, and customer feedback interpretation**.

## 🧠 Features  
✔️ Analyze any text and detect underlying emotions  
✔️ Multiple emotion categories for better granularity  
✔️ Powered by **NLP + Machine Learning**  
✔️ Simple & interactive **web app interface**  
✔️ Scalable for real-world applications (chatbots, feedback analysis, etc.)
